# CNN-Architecture-Search-Based-on-Evolutionary-Algorithms

Abstract: The Neural Architectural Search methodology is an automated architecture search methodology for neural networks.Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) created using NAS approaches have recently produced outstanding results in a variety of applications, including image classification and natural language processing. This project is in the same NAS domain,and we use an evolutionary algorithm augmented with a multi-objective non-dominated sort algorithm (NSGA II) to traverse the search space of neural network topologies.
